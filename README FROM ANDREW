Finished with Boss + Boss behaviour. Used the Object.watch method of javascript, meaning we either have to exclude the 
IE users OR implement a liscense free public usable javascript code that I found, which lets you use object.watch on
every platform

The boss I think, as of now, is fairly challenging, but not impossible.

Changed the "points" in HTML + JS file into an object rather than an int type to enable object.watch
