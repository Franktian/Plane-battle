Well since there was no note of when we will be meeting, I just want to say I would like to add a moving background
so that it actually looks like the plane is moving upwards the screen + other than that I would suggest adding bomb (space)
counters, so you can only use 2 before you pick up more bomb ammos, and lets add more stuff like power up pick-ups 
and such. But im guessing you already had this in mind

UPDATE!
I added Bomb Counter and not allowing the user to hold down the space button for the bomb action
I added scrolling BG, but currently it just stretches the current BG's height by 2 and scrolls down BUT
this means that the BG can come to an end.
Here is the Question, how do you want the game to work? do you want it to work that theres an end boss where the BG
stops scrolling down? ex. 1942 (the game), or make it act like it never ends, so that the scrolling animation loops?
while on the subject, do you want the game to have a HP bar system? or a 1 hit die multiple life system?
